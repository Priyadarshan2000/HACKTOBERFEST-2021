// Definition of Overriding :
/**
 *  In Java, method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) has the same method as the parent class
 *  The function should have same signatures in the terms of name or anything except the inner body
 *  let us see an example of it first
 */

    }
}


// Second class that is extending the A class ( extends is used for inheritance )
class B extends A{

    void printString(int a){                    // Again the same function is redefined with same signature and name
        // Every thing is same , only the inside code is different
